# OpenPhoda-SeV
Open Source version of the Phoda-SeV scale for Chronic Low Back Pain

The university of University of LEUVEN releases a proprietary version of the Phoda-SeV for MS Windows computers. I thought it may have been useful to create a version of the software which (provided that a browser and internet connection is available) is capable to:

* run on any possible machine at any time 
* add data to a single, fast and reliable relational database

## What is OpenPhoda-SeV?

OpenPhoda-SeV is a shortened electronic version of the PHODA (Photograph Series of Daily Activities), a diagnostic tool using which uses photographs to determine the threat value of different physical activities and movements. Exactly like Phoda-SeV this tool offers a quick and simple way for therapists to create a fear hierarchy for patients that may be influenced by some degree of fear of movement.
