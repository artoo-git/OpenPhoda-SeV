	<p><a href="https://github.com/artoo-git/OpenPhoda-SeV">Open Source version of the Phoda-SeV</a> scale for Chronic Low Back Pain</p>

	<p>The University of Leuven releases a proprietary version of the Phoda-SeV in "Windows" format. I thought it may have been useful to create a version of the software which (provided that a browser and internet connection is available) is capable to:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>run on any possible machine at any time </li>

	<li>add data to a single, fast and reliable relational database</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2> OpenPhoda-SeV is free to use on this website </h2>
	<p>I have installed a fully functioning version of OpenPhoda on this website and it is free to use. I cannot guarantee how long this instance will run but if you are concerned or if you want to know more about OpenPhoda drop me a message <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/diego-vitali"> here </a></p>
	<h2 id="whatisopenphodasev">What is OpenPhoda-SeV?</h2>

	<p><a href="https://github.com/artoo-git/OpenPhoda-SeV">OpenPhoda-SeV</a> is a shortened electronic version of the PHODA (Photograph Series of Daily Activities), a diagnostic tool using which uses photographs to determine the threat value of different physical activities and movements. Exactly like <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/ogp/labfacilities">Phoda-SeV</a> this tool offers a quick and simple way for therapists to create a fear hierarchy for patients that may be influenced by some degree of fear of movement. </p>
